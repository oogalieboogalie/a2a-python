        A sink whose queue has filled up would, with a blocking put, stall
        this dispatcher's ``gather`` until the sink drains: if it never does,
        the incoming queue then fills, producers wedge in ``enqueue_event``,
        and the task's event flow never recovers. Sinks tapped with
        ``evict_on_full=True`` are therefore treated as broadcast observers:
        when full, the sink is force-closed and detached so dispatch to the
        remaining sinks continues and blocked producers recover. Sinks with
        ``evict_on_full=False`` (including the default sink) keep the blocking
        put, which is the documented flow-control contract.

        The eviction condition is queue fullness at delivery time, which says
        nothing about why the consumer is behind. A departed consumer and a
        slow one are evicted alike.

        The ``full()`` pre-check is race-free: this dispatcher is the only
        writer to a sink queue and consumers only read, so the queue cannot
        grow between the check and the put.

        A sink that closed after the dispatch snapshot was taken (e.g. a
        graceful ``close(immediate=False)`` whose consumer is still
        draining) is skipped: treating its full queue as an eviction
        candidate would upgrade the close to immediate and discard the
        events the consumer is draining. The check is best-effort — a
        close landing after it is harmless, because the put below
        tolerates a shut-down queue.
